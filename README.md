### User Flow
I and the designer worked together to understand the employer's needs and how we could create an app that would meet those needs in the most efficient and effective manner. We went through the process of mapping out the app's flow and identifying what features and functionality would be required to meet the employer's requirements. We discussed various options and considered the pros and cons of each approach to arrive at a solution that we believe will provide the best results for the employer. Through this collaboration, we were able to create a solid plan for the app that we believe will deliver the desired outcome and meet the employer's expectations.

_ These user flows were made using FigJam _ 

By creating user flows, we can visualize all the potential paths a user may take within the app. This helps us to consider every action a user might take, ensuring that they are guided smoothly through the app and do not become confused or frustrated with its navigation.
